# group4-project2
*Name TBD* Project 2 for UNC Chapel Hill's Programming Bootcamp utilizing backend logic


## User Story
As a user, I want to create a user profile so I can login and play a fun interactive game. I want my account information to be saved upon logging in and logging out. Once logged in, I want to be able to view my current highest score. I also want to search and find friends by their username or first and last name to view their current highest score. I want to seamlessly navigate to and from the home page, high scores page, user search page, and account page. I also want to be able to logout of my account once I am done playing.
